# Installation & Development

To start vite:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start vite, and will hot-reload changes.

## Multiplayer

The multiplayer server is not started automatically along with vite. To start the multiplayer server:

```
npm run multiplayer-server
```

## Recommended Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously Volar) and disable Vetur

- Use [vue-tsc](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/tsc) for performing the same type checking from the command line, or for generating d.ts files for SFCs.
